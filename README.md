📘 Assignment: Customize Your GitHub Copilot Experience

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to configure and document project-level GitHub Copilot guidance so teammates (and future you) get consistent, helpful suggestions. By the end of this assignment you will update the repository's Copilot instructions and write a concise guide describing the changes.

## ⏱️ Estimated time

30–60 minutes

## 🧭 Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with Git and GitHub

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Task 1 — Inspect the repository

#### Description
Open the repository and locate any existing Copilot guidance or dev-container configuration (look under `.github/` and `.devcontainer/`).

#### Requirements

- Note where current guidance exists (file paths).

---

### 🛠️ Task 2 — Update `copilot-instructions.md`

#### Description
Edit the file `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to include clear, project-specific guidance: preferred language, style, coding conventions, and any areas Copilot should avoid. Keep the tone helpful and concise.

#### Requirements

- Add at least 4 concrete guidance bullets (language, style, examples, do/don't).
- Make the instructions actionable and student-friendly.

---

### 🛠️ Task 3 — Add a short usage guide

#### Description
Create or update a short README section describing how contributors should use the Copilot guidance and how to test it locally (e.g., open the repo in the dev container or VS Code with the Copilot extension).

#### Requirements

- Include one example prompt that follows the guidance.
- Describe how to verify the behavior locally.

## ✅ Deliverables
